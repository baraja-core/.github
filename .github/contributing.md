How to contribute & use the issue tracker
=========================================

Baraja welcomes your contributions. There are several ways to help out:

* Create an issue on GitHub, if you have found a bug
* Write test cases for open bug issues
* Write fixes for open bug/feature issues, preferably with test cases included

Issues
------

Keep it short, clear. Include all necessary details and links to other sources.

A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more
information. Please try to be as detailed as possible in your report.

**Feature requests** are welcome. But take a moment to find out whether your idea
fits with the scope and aims of the project. It's up to *you* to make a strong
case to convince the project's developers of the merits of this feature.

Contributing
------------

If you want to contribute to the code, send a Pull Request.

A Pull Request should only edit one specific thing at a time. If you are solving multiple problems, send multiple Pull Requests.

Be sure to describe all changes and explain the functionality to other developers.

It is not appropriate to send changes that change the internal architecture. Always keep backward compatibility and security in mind.

Please do not fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch.

Thanks! :heart:
